## Project Brief
* Develop an eCommerce Desktop Application using React & Electron
* Implement Back-end functionality using Node.js
* Implement an account system with an SQL database
* Provide clear UI/UX design through the use of CSS
* Utilise the [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) API to dynamically retrieve product data using JSON
* Provide functionality to search for and view specific products
* Include a checkout system with a basket and purchases
* Implement a product library that reflects product purchases, with sorting and filtering options
* Retain user activity across sessions (Recently viewed products, current basket)

## Approach

### Planning & Analysis

Prior to any design or development, I started by defining the key goals and researching which languages, frameworks and other tools I will utilise for the application.

This involved:

* Research into the IGDB API service and how I could utilise this to dynamically provide up to date products and data to the application, rather than implementing static pages with pre-defined data.
* Looking at the Electron framework and determining its effectiveness in helping me achieve my design goals compared to other desktop application options.
* Performing analysis on similar contemporary applications to determine essential features and possible UI/UX design inspiration.

After these steps were performed, I created a list of essential, non-essential and luxury requirements; from both a functional and non-functional perspective.

Some examples include:

* Sorting Algorithms for Product Library
* Search by Genre, New / Upcoming Release options
* Consistent UI/UX across application
* Video Player on Product Page for YouTube Links from IGDB API

As well as some features that did not end up being implemented in this version, such as:

* Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle
* Parental Controls

## Project Planning Diagrams

### Application Navigation Diagram

This diagram was created to define the expected way in which the user can navigate from page to page in the application

### UI/UX Storyboards

Several wireframes were created to represent each component in the application, with some annotations to make clear some expected interactions.
